# Welcome to my Blog

Welcome to my blog, my little corner in the internet where I get to do whatever I want. Currently, the only purpose of the website is to share apps where I apply some of the new things I learn day by day. If you’d like to be a part of my programmnig journey, don’t hesitate on visint from time to time and checking out some of the features I add or apps that I develop.

## Currently working on…

Below is a list of the features, apps, bug fixes, and other stuff that I’m working on. I try to keep this list updated but have in mind that I don’t always feel like writing, so it might be a bit inaccurate.

- Spotify Search App
- Implementing login
- Fixing some tools
- Thinking of new ideas!

## Why is it public?

I decided to make this repository public because I’m a beginner. I’d appreciate any feedback on my code, whether that be on structure, implementation, or overall efficiency.
